Her parents were devout Baptists, so she was exposed to church choir at an early age. Her parents instantly recognized her singing ability when they witnessed two-year-old Avril singing ‘Jesus Loves Me’ while they were on the way to their home from Church.</p><p>Avril’s parents supported her career choice and encouraged her to sing in the choir to sharpen her vocal talents.</p><p>Her father was also a music enthusiast who used to play bass in their family church occasionally. He used to buy her every instrument that she needed to enhance her singing ability. When she was five, he converted their basements into a studio and bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars.</p><p>When Avril stepped into her teenage years, she started playing the guitar and writing songs. Avril’s first song, ‘Can’t Stop Thinking About You,’ was about a teenage crush. Before turning to a pop-punk kind of music, Avril reportedly used to sing country music at her initial stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Avril-Lavigne-Posing-in-the-photo-and-stating-she-wants-to-move-back.jpg><p>Her parents used to take her for Karaoke sessions, and she used to perform at county fairs, where she sang songs of artists like Garth Brooks, the Chicks, and Shania Twain.</p><p>Avril Lavigne also has an older brother named Mathew and a younger sister named Michele Lavigne. Both of her siblings used to tease Avril for singing. She said, “My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep, and he thought it was annoying.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=avril-lavigne-and-adam-levine>Avril Lavigne and Adam Levine</h3><p>Several people think that Avril is related to Maroon 5’s frontman Adam Levine. Although they have a similar-sounding name, the two talented singers are sadly not related to each other.</p><p>Apart from her singing abilities, Avril was also a great hockey player in her earlier days in high school. She won the MVP award twice as a right-winger in the boys league.</p><p>However, Avril never enjoyed going to school and was repeatedly removed from her classes for misbehaving. Lavigne immediately dropped out of high school when she bagged herself a record deal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=avril-lavigne-relationships-and-dating-history>relationships and dating history</h2><p>Throughout the years, Avril has been romantically linked to several famous people. However, the ‘Complicated’ singer has gone through some complex relationships in the past. So, we are guessing she defiantly meant every word while singing Complicated.</p><p>Although Avril does not have a long list of boyfriends like several celebs, she has dated or married some famous people from the music industry.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>Isabel Ruby Lieberstein</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=deryck-whibley>Deryck Whibley</h3><p>Avril’s first high-profile relationship started when she dated her friend, Deryck Jason Whibley. Deryck is a Canadian singer and producer best known to be the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, principal songwriter, and producer of the rock band named Sum 41.</p><p>Both Avril and Deryck were only good friends for two years before they officially started dating in 2003. At that time, Avril was only 19 years old. The pair had a strong bond, and fans often saw Avril and Deruck performing together.</p><p>After two years of dating, Deryck took Lavigne for a romantic trip to Venice. He had reportedly also prepared a gondola ride and a romantic picnic for her. And by June 27, news broke out that Deryck had proposed Avril and that the pair were finally engaged.</p><p>The pair finally sealed the deal on July 15, 2006, after a year of the proposal. The couple organized their wedding in a private estate in Montecito, California, where only 110 guests attended the ceremony. Avril wore a gown designed by Vera Wong and walked down the aisle with her father to Mendelssohn’s ‘Wedding March.’ Both Avril and Deryck chose Goo Goo Doll’s ‘Iris’ for their first dance.</p><p>Few months after their wedding, Avril revealed that she was the best thing that happened to Deryck. She said that she helped him quit drugs since they started dating. She said, “I wouldn’t be with someone who did drugs, and I made that very clear to him when we started dating. I am 100 percent against drugs.”</p><p>The couple remained married for three years but announced that they were calling in quits on September 17, 2009. Avril filed for divorce on October 9, 2009. She also released a statement that read, “I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.”</p><p>Although the pair’s married life was relatively short, they remain good friends to date.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=brody-jenner>Brody Jenner</h3><p>After ending things with Deryck Whibley, Avril started dating famous reality star Brody Jenner a few months after her divorce. The pair went public in early 2010. They occasionally walked around Hollywood and even went for a double date with Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries.</p><p>Both Avril and Brody had also tattooed each other’s name on their body. However, the pair called it quits after dating for two years in 2012.</p><p>Although neither Brody nor Avril publishes any statement after ending their relationship, several sources state that they mainly broke up because Avril wanted to settle down while Brody was not exactly ready.</p><p>Likewise, the pair’s different level of career also affected their relationship. While Avril was a significant and successful star in the music industry, Brody struggled to name himself in Hollywood. Sources close to the pair claimed Brody was tired of being her plus-one and always traveling with her.</p><p>Brody also stated, “I need to stay in L.A. and get back to T.V. Either scripted or reality. But I feel like a loser.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=chad-kroeger>Chad Kroeger</h3><p>After splitting with Brody Jenner, Avril was then dating Nickelback’s frontman, Chad Kroeger. Avril and Chad had met for the first time when they worked together to write and record music for her fifth album.</p><p>The pair then started dating soon after and were engaged within a month of dating in August 2012. Chad had gifted Lavigne with a massive 14-carat diamond engagement ring during his proposal.</p><p>The couple exchanged their vows on July 1, 2013, at the Chateau de la Napoule on the Mediterranean in the South of France.</p><p>Avril’s second wedding ceremony was quite different compared to her first wedding ceremony. While she chose to be entirely traditional for the first one, she decided to include a bit of her for her second wedding. Avril organized a gothic-themed wedding and even wore a gothic gown for her wedding with Chad.</p><p>The ceremony took place on the same day as Canada day and included close family and friends only. The pair had worked together and wrote a song called ‘If I said I Loved You’ for their first dance.</p><p>However, despite having a perfect wedding, the couple called it quits after a year of blissful marriage. Lavigne announced that she was separating from Chad through her Instagram account on September 2, 2015.</p><p>The main reason for their break up was due to their busy lives and schedules. However, despite the ending of their marriage Avril and Chad still work together and remain close friends. In 2017, Avril even surprised her fans by joining Nickelback at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles to sing their song Rockstar.</p><p><strong>Read about</strong> <a href=#>Tommy Lee</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=ryan-cabrera>Ryan Cabrera</h3><p>Avril Lavigne was also romantically linked to singer and longtime friend Ryan Cabrera.

Rotem, Avril Lavigne dated Philip Sarofim, the son of Egyptian American Billionaire Fayez Sarofim, in 2018. They reportedly met through friends and dated for less than two years. The pair went on few dates, shopping in the West Hollywood neighborhood of L.A., and even silent auctions in Beverly Hills.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=pete-jonas>Pete Jonas</h3><p>Avril Lavigne and Pete Jonas were first seen together with some friends in November 2019. The two sparked dating rumors when their representatives announced that Avril had broken up with Philip Sarofim. Both Pete and Avril were holding hands and were even snuggling to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Gala in Beverly Jills in January 2020.</p><p>Some sources even state that Pete worked as Lavigne’s vocal producer, pianist, and guitarist.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=derek-smith-mod-sun>Derek Smith (Mod Sun)</h3><p>Currently, Avril is dating American rapper Derek Smith, known by his stage name Mod Sun. The pair recently also worked and released a song called ‘Flames’ in January 2021.</p><p>Some sources also revealed that Mod Sun has already taken their relationship to the next level by getting Avril’s named tattooed on his neck. Although the couple has not confirmed their connection with the public, they are often going on dates and spending time together in and out of the recording studio.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-avril-lavigne-have-any-children>Does Avril Lavigne have any children?</h2><p>Although Avril Lavigne has been in several relationships and was married twice, she does not have any children. However, she has often expressed in some interviews that she wants to become a mother someday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=avril-lavigne-career>Avril Lavigne career</h2><p>Avril Lavigne was already building her career by the age of 15. She sang in different fairs and community theatres and had even won a radio contest that allowed her to sing on a stage with Shania Twain.</p><p>Avril was then discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, in 1999 while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Ontario. After that, Fabri connected her to Mark Jowett, from Nettwerk, who flew her to New York to work with Peter Zizzo in 2000.</p><p>During her trip to New York, Avril was then discovered by Artista Records, leading her to sign a $2 million two-album deal with the label. After the record deal, Avril quit high school and moved to Manhattan to work with some songwriters and producers. But her partnership with songwriters only led her to make country music which did not fit her personality, as she was more into rock music.</p><p>Artista then sent Lavigne to Los Angeles, where she worked with writing teams like the Matrix, through which she was able to create her melodic yet edgy debut/ first album, Let Go, in 2002.</p><p>While forming her first album, Nettwerk also helped Avril arrange her band members, who mainly came from Closet Monster, a punk rock band from Ajax, Ontario. Nettwerk reportedly chose the Closet Monster members because they were up and coming from a punk rock scene that perfectly fit Avril’s personality.</p><p>Through Let Go, Lavigne became the first youngest female singer ever to have a number one album in the U.K. The album also reached number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart.</p><p>Her singles from her first album, like Complicated, Sk8er Boi, and I’m With You, were at the top ten in the Billboard’s Mainstream Top 40. Moreover, she became the second artist in history to make it to the list. Avril then set out for her <a href=# rel=nofollow>first-ever world tour</a>,’ Try to Shut Me Up Tour’ after her album release.</p><p>After releasing her first album, Avril became a breath of fresh air in the music industry. Her song genre was edgy and fell more into a pop-punk category, quite different from skin-bearing teen idols. Furthermore, her presence in the industry did not rely on sexy videos or suggestive music, leading her to be more popular and unique.</p><p>Due to her varied presence, Avril was also nominated in Grammy’s for several categories, mainly for her songs like Complicated and Sk8er Boi.</p><p>Following her debut album’s blowup success, Avril further distinguished herself by working with professional writing teams to create her second album.</p><p>For her second album, she worked with Chantal Kreviazuk, Evanescence’s Ben Moody, and Evan Taubenfeld.</p><p>Avril’s second album, Under My Skin, was released two years after her debut album in 2004. In Under My Skin, she included songs dealing with premarital sex, depression, and even her grandfather’s death.</p><p>Avril had collaborated with guitarist Phil X for her songs like ‘He Wasn’t,’ ‘How Does It Feel,’ ‘Together,’ ‘Forgotten,’ and ‘Fall To Pieces’ for this album. Phil X is a well-known Canadian musician who has played as lead guitarist for bands like Bon Jovi. And just like her first album, Under My Skin, too, hit the charts.</p><p>Avril’s second album was number one in more than ten countries and even went platinum within one month. Under My Skin allowed Lavigne to establish herself further as a successful pop icon in the music industry. Furthermore, she then conducted her second world tour, which was titled ‘Bonez Tour.’</p><p>After her popularity and release of her second album, Avril even played a role in the animated movie called Over the Hedge. The film released in 2006 and Lavigne voiced the character named Heather, a hungry opossum. She also made an appearance in Richard Linklater’s fictional adaptation of Fast Food Nation the same year.</p><p>Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at Cannes Film Festival in 2006.</p><p>Apart from making an appearance in films, Avril also worked on her third album in 2006. She worked with Blink-182’s drummer Travis Barker, her then-husband Deryck Whibley, and cherry-picked various other producers to create her third album.</p><p>Her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was released in April 2007. The album’s lead single ‘Girlfriend’ caused copyright claims by 70s power pop band, the Rubinoos, who sued her with claims that Avril’s song was a reworked version of their song ‘I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.’ However, despite the backlash, The Best Dam Thing still topped charts worldwide, and ‘Girlfriend’ became Lavigne’s most significant single in the U.S.</p><p>To promote her third album, Lavigne held her third world tour, which was called ‘The Best Damn Tour,’</p><p>Avril’s fourth album Goodbye Lullaby was released in 2011. The subject of the songs in the album was mainly about her dissolved relationship with her ex-husband Deryck. Ironically, the album also included songs that Deryck Whibley himself produced.</p><p>Avril held her fourth tour called ‘Black Star Tour’ in Asia, America, and Europe to promote the album.</p><p>Soon after the release of her fourth album, Avril started working on her next record. For her eponymous fifth album, she worked with Nickelback’s frontman and then-husband Chad Kroeger. The album was released in 2013 and included eight songs that Kroeger himself co-wrote. Avril and Chad also duetted for the album’s third single, ‘Let Me Go.’</p><p>To promote her eponymous album, Avril went on a tour called ‘The Avril Lavigne Tour’ from 2013-2014.</p><p>Around the early month of 2015, Avril also released a song called ‘Fly,’ a ballad written for the Special Olympics World Summer Games. After that, she took a break from her music to heal from her Lyme disease.</p><p>Avril then released a single/ title track called ‘Head Above Water’ in 2018. The song was about her struggles with Lyme disease. Her sixth album, Head Over Water, fell more into the secular pop genre and was released in February 2019.</p><p>Avril also appeared in the Tonight Show hosted by Jimmy Fallon to promote her album, where she performed her title track for the show’s audiences. Likewise, she was also a guest in Jay Leno’s Emmy-winning series called Jay Leno’s Garage after her album release. The episode that is almost 20 minutes long is available on CNBC Prime’s YouTube account.</p><p>Head Above Water reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. It also reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard 200.</p><p>Avril also recorded one of the songs from the album called Warrior and released it as a single, titled, ‘We Are Warriors.’ Avril gave the profits raised from the music to Project HOPE’S relief effort during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Currently, Avril is working on new music, which she revealed that she would be releasing in 2021. She confirmed that she is collaborating with music producers like John Feldmann, Mod Sun, Travis Barker, and Machine Gun Kelly for her new songs.</p><p>On January 8, 2021, she released the song ‘Flames’ in collaboration with her current boyfriend, Mod Sun. On Instagram, she also replied to a fan stating that her seventh album’s recording is also completed.</p><p>Today, up and coming artist like Billie Eilish’s work is often compared to Avril Lavigne’s work. Most fans even state that both the artists have a similar type of musical journey. Billie Eilish also revealed that Avril helped her become who she is now.</p><p>Eilish once posted a picture of her and Avril after meeting her, where she captioned the photo, “THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME WHAT I AM.”</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)</a></p><p>Apart from her musical career, Avril Lavigne also has a fashion live called ‘Abby Dawn,’ which she had created in 2008.

But after winning her battle with the disease, she said that she was in bed for two years due to her painful condition. However, her Lyme disease experience led her to write her first comeback song called ‘Head Above Water.’</p><p>After her Lyme disease experience, Avril became quite vocal and tried to spread awareness about the disease as much as she can. She revealed that she even offered to help fellow Canadian singer Justin Bieber when he announced that he had contracted the disease. She also told her inspiration for her song ‘Warrior’ was born after discovering Bieber was suffering from the disease.</p><p>She said, “He is also a warrior overcoming Lyme, and that was the whole inspiration behind my song, ‘Warrior.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=avril-lavigne-net-worth>Avril Lavigne net worth</h2><p>Avril has a <strong>net worth of USD 60 million</strong> that she collected by selling millions of copies of her singles and six albums and going through world tours after the release of her each album.

Like any other celebrity, Avril has gone through several dramas throughout her musical career.</p><p>One of Lavigne’s most popular controversies was when several media outlets started to publish that she was dead and was replaced by a clone named Melissa in 2003. The theory claimed that Avril struggled with fame initially, leading her to use a body double named Melissa. Furthermore, people also stated that Avril died, leading her record company to replace her with Melissa full time.</p><p>Many theorists support their body double theory by stating that Melissa left clues in songs such as ‘Slipped Away,’ where she sings, “The day you slipped away was the day I found it won’t be the same.”</p><p>Likewise, since Avril had a different musical influence in the music industry, she was often compared with pop stars like Britney Spears. Several people also called her anti-Britney for being less commercial and having an actual image. Such perception led many people to think Avril had a feud with Britney Spears.</p><p>However, Avril silenced all the speculation and supported Spears when she stated in an interview that the concept of anti-Britney was stupid. She said, “I don’t believe in that. She’s a human being. God, leave her alone.”</p><p>Another famous controversy Avril got connected to was with renowned singer Rihanna. Although both the stars make different types of music, one of Rihanna’s best hits would not have existed without Avril. That’s right, you heard it right; Rihanna’s hit song Cheers (Drink to That) includes Avril’s sample voice that was recorded while creating her single ‘I’m With You.’</p><p>Although Rihanna suffered several backlashes for using Avril’s sample, instead of denying the claims, she stated that she was glad she could use Avril’s voice, as if it were not for her, the vibe of the song would not have been the same.</p><p>Avril was also called racist for her Hello Kitty music video from her fifth album. The singer had included a Japanese background dancer in her video, causing her to go through plenty of backlashes. The singer defended herself by stating that she likes Japan and is usually in Japan half of the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=avril-lavigne-social-media>Avril Lavigne social media</h2><p>Avril Lavigne is active in almost all popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</p><p>She goes by @avrillavigne on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her Instagram.</a> She has more than eight million followers in her Instagram account.
