But thanks to the input of the series’ Native crew and the community members of its primary filming location, real-life Okmulgee, the <a href=#>Reservation Dogs</a> hometown crackles with energy and life. It’s cliché to say a TV series setting is a character, but with its precise and unexpected details —&nbsp;as minute as the type of flowers used for a funeral service and as sobering as the reflection of moonlight on a dorm-room floor as two nuns drag a screaming child across it&nbsp;— Okern was. Every aspect of Reservation Dogs’ look was crafted with intention, and it showed onscreen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a34um001x3b7jufomoavi@published data-word-count=103>“When we’re creating and decorating the sets, we’re thinking about the people who will be watching at home, sure. But we’re equally, if not more, thinking about the people who will be in the room when it actually happens,” says production designer Brandon Tonner-Connolly, who joined the series after its pilot and worked on all three seasons. “We’re thinking about the crew and cast who are from the community, and the people down the block who might stop by to watch filming. We want them to feel the spaces are right.

Those locations roughly divide into two categories: The reservation’s homes and communal spaces are “washed with warmth and comfort and cozy,” reflecting the Native aesthetic Sampson grew up with in Okmulgee (her father is the late actor Tim Sampson). “There’s never any coldness or harsh lines; everything’s warm wood and soft goods and little lighting and handwritten notes and junk mail,” she explains. “Little things everywhere, that’s how my dad was.” Then, as the series progressed, it went darker, spending significant time illuminating the space that tried to stamp out and exploit Native identity: the Indian boarding school.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a34x3001y3b7jdfk2d07d@published data-word-count=104>Depicting the range of Native experience was essential to Reservation Dogs co-creator, director, and writer Sterlin Harjo, as was filming nearly every scene on location in Oklahoma. Tonner-Connolly and Sampson spoke to Vulture about collaborating on the show’s definitive and most involved sets and how their teams worked to align these spaces with “the universe of Reservation Dogs,” as Tonner-Connolly puts it. “You’re giving people the opportunity to experience life in a different place,” he explains. “The character details we put into a set create intimacy, and intimacy builds empathy, and conveying that experience helps someone understand and feel another kind of person’s world.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln3a3gxe00283b7jjk80gqxq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Okern Indian Health Clinic</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/08f/e63/1c2597d0d0209d518952fb7763f4d9301d-IHS-Outside-Mural-2-of-2.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ce6/28e/b449d30f7d7ed9e0cee2d149e937c3acdd-IHS-Inside-Mural.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <strong class=caption-prefix></strong> <span class=full><strong class=caption-prefix></strong></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2cc/eee/c814f186dfb7f51f9391e7e65e9fd935fa-IHS-Spirit-Anatomy-Poster.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cbb/04e/fd5d598f2aa0c74ba5b2d42d5178fbf4e6-Eagles-Corner-Outside.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <strong class=caption-prefix></strong> <span class=full><strong class=caption-prefix></strong></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a7v06002s3b7jdrl3yx6u@published data-word-count=104>Introduced in the series’ second episode, “<a href=#>NDN Clinic</a>,” the medical center that employs and treats many of the Rez Dogs’ relatives and mentors became a recurring location as well as the starting point for the formation of many unlikely bonds.

How do we make this place seem kind of terrifying, but there’s tenderness surrounding it and you don’t want to leave? The pillowcase Bear is sleeping on was my great-grandma’s pillowcase. On Maximus’s counter, we have boxes of Little Debbie Star Crunch cookies. We ended up consulting with amazing people like Harvey Pratt, who is a Native forensic artist.

We had a swirling star chart painted on the wall next to where Bear would wake up. I don’t think you saw it in the episode, but we had the night sky painted on the ceiling of the trailer so Maximus could sit on his couch and look up and see his idea of the stars above him. In the greenhouse, we have a medicine-wheel-like symbol with a star chart painted on the wall. The tunnel has similar symbols in it for Bear to find glimpses of. We brought in vintage wallpaper and wood paneling to create some visual chaos with all the different newspaper textures inside the trailer.

Peppered with flashbacks to one of the notorious boarding schools that abducted Native children from their families and violently forced assimilation upon them, the season-three episode is both a horror movie and an origin story for Okern’s mythical vigilante. Its period-piece accuracy was accomplished through what Tonner-Connolly describes as “copious, copious” research into the destructive impact of boarding schools. What no one could prepare for, though, was the electrical fire that burned down the warehouse holding production’s materials for the episode.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3aun5s00ct3b7jnliotbf9@published data-word-count=92><strong>B T-C: </strong>Before we started the season officially, we were trying to find any photo of a boarding school from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, especially on the Plains. Tafv went to Anadarko, Oklahoma, to meet with people at the historical archives and gather images, and we had a consultant come onboard, Denise K. Lajimodiere, who is the author of Stringing Rosaries: The History, the Unforgivable, and the Healing of Northern Plains American Indian Boarding School Survivors. She answered our many questions about plates, spoons, bedding, desks, everything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3gguou001d3b7lms2wuslc@published data-word-count=109>Once we had all the research, we found Bacone College. It allowed us to shoot almost everything from that episode on this one campus. <a href=#>Danis Goulet</a>, the director, came in with amazing visual ideas, including giving the episode a very ’70s-horror aesthetic with long lenses and this palpable sense of dread. We talked about <a href=#>Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria</a> and a few other films as color-palette references. The genre aesthetic was a nice way of making the incredibly weighty subject matter a little more digestible, so it felt fantastical or like a dream rather than a gritty doc. It also set this particular episode aside in its own very separate universe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3av21j00d13b7jo9lu7q0l@published data-word-count=152>We started in this giant hall that was being used as a storage room. It had mounted flatscreen TVs, low-pile carpet, reminders that we were in the year 2023. I looked at the references and picked out some period elements that were important, like a hardwood floor with very high gloss so it kicked back moonlight during the night scenes and added this mythical feeling. We incorporated small decorative crosses on the wood paneling so you always feel hemmed in by the religious element of the surroundings. Our art director, Matt Hyland, and our construction coordinator, Aaron Maier, were able to build and install this flooring, this paneling, and a million other details in this very large space. The whole thing has a really heavy, emotional weight of this terrible history. We had to be really mindful of the toll it may take on people in the art department and everybody else.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3av5tr00d83b7jbilvbfi0@published data-word-count=116><strong>TS: </strong>We had a lot of crew members who had relatives at boarding school at that time. There was a lot of crying. That episode was not only emotionally tough, but our warehouse burned down the week before with everything in it. They ruled it to be an electrical fire. Because of time and money, we had to keep going. There was no way we could stop filming. I was like, Am I going about this with the respect that it needs? I didn’t smudge the beds when they came into the warehouse. I was going a mile a minute.

That warehouse was our base of logistics — where all the construction stuff was, where we cut all the wood, where we paint. The construction department set up a satellite shop at Bacone College and were living out the back of a trailer. It was like, yes, this is terrible; yes, we’re all logistically and emotionally affected by this. But at the same time, we’ve got to do this thing. If we don’t do it, nobody’s gonna do it.
